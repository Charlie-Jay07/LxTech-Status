*Oï»¿ngoing -* The development team at LxTechnologies are working on getting the bots core functions back up to pace. We are also working on a few bug fixes with the leaderboard/levels system. And some moderation commands. The **API** is being fixed regarding the database management as once a guild reset in one server the whole bot system reset. We have chosen to close off the leaderboard/level command since it causes a whole bot crash causing us to need to restart the bot. We can not risk doing this when the bot grows as that will cause mass disruption.\
\
*Resolved* - The Leaderboard/Leveling up system has been fixed and is now open. Meaning the API and Database are now up and running perfectly. The API is now fixed and so is all the root services.
