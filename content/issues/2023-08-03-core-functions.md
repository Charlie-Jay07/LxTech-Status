*Oï»¿ngoing -* The development team at LxTechnologies are working on getting the bots core functions back up to pace. We are also working on a few bug fixes with the leaderboard/levels system. And some moderation commands. The **API** is being fixed regarding the database management as once a guild reset in one server the whole bot system reset. We have chosen to close off the leaderboard/level command since it causes a whole bot crash causing us to need to restart the bot. We can not risk doing this when the bot grows as that will cause mass disruption.
